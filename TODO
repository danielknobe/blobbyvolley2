======= TODO
Primary:
Important:
- Compilation tutorial for Linux-Users (for Linux allready done)
- Redesign of the GUI system, it is designed too simple and doesn't allow
	many features of the original GUI
- New RenderMangerfunctions to hide ingamegraphics

Near aims:
- Gamepadsupport
- Make rendering frame independent, so the same gameplay can be provided on older machindes with a lower rendering framerate

Secondary:
- Add animated background (prerendered Animations, at least for SDL and GL2D)
- Add option for old and new volleyball ruleset
- Add time-capped game option
- Add speed option
- Make Code compatible with gcc -Wall
