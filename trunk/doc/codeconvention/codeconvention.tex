\section{Structure of Files}
This chapter gives an overview about the used .cpp and .h file structure convention used in the Blobby Volley 2 project.
If you want to contribute some code to the project it's important you take care of it.
\subsection{Headerfile}
Every headerfile of Blobby Volley 2 needs in top of the page the license and author text shown in listing \ref{lst:headerOfHeaderFile}.

\subsection{Bodyfile}


\subsection{Includes}
Includes are to be sorted by library. They should occur in the following order:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stdlib
	\item Boost
	\item Other 3rd party libraries we use (for Example: lua, tinyxml, raknet, SDL)
	\item Blobby
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Coding Style}
This section describes the coding style. If you think something is missing just add it.


\subsubsection{Common}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Opening curly braces are placed in a new line
	\item Closing curly braces are followed by an empty line
	\item The left indention should be done by tabs, the rest by spaces
	\item Do not write more than one statement into one source line
	\item Break statements within switch are followed by an empty line
	\item Use smart pointers when ever possible
	\item Code should be gcc 4.6 compatible
	\item Code should compile in c++11 mode
	\item Don't use the deprecated exception handling of older c++ versions
	\item Binary/ternary operators are seperated from their operands by spaces (exception: long expression - for grouping purposes)
	\item Leaving out braces for one line code blocks after if/for is allowed when the following instruction takes only one line, but must be followed by an empty line 
	\item Use c++ headers instead of c ones for stdlib includes (e.g. <cmath> indstead of <math.h>)
	\item Use c++ strings instead of c strings if possible
	\item Prefer references over pointers
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Classes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Class names start with an upper case letter
	\item Member variables are to be prefixed with m
	\item Member functions start with a lower case letter
	\item Members occur in the following order: public, protected, private
	\item Access level specifiers (is it called that way? / public, protected, private) are indented one level
	\item Members are indented two levels
	\item For big classes, it might be a good idea to group member functions into different categories
	\item Initialize members by constructers initphase whenever possible
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Namespaces}
TODO


\section{Things you should not do}
Every contribution with this attributes will be rejected.



\subsection{Pattern}
The following patterns are not allowed to use:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Singleton (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern})
\end{itemize}
 


\section{Stuff that must be integrated in this file correctly}
TODO:
- Write a more detailed code-convention document
- Detailed desription of every section needed

Following files implement the convention:
- RenderManagerSDL.cpp
- RenderManagerGL2D.cpp
- UserConfig.cpp
- TextManager.cpp
- SpeedController.cpp
- SoundManager.cpp
- ScriptedInputSource.cpp
- ReplayRecorder.cpp
- ReplayPlayer.cpp
- RenderManagerGP2X.cpp
- RenderManager.cpp
- Player.cpp
- PhysicWorld.cpp
- NetworkMessage.cpp
TODO:
- all .cpp in subfolder
- src folder a - NetworkGame.cpp
- ReplayLoader.cpp
