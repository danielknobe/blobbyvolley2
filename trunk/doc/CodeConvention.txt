/* header include */

/* includes */

/* implementation */


includes are to be sorted by library. they should occur in the following order:
 std   includes
 boost includes
 other 3rd party libraries we use (lua/tinyxml/raknet/SDL)
 blobby includes



Coding Style:
 * opening curly braces are placed in a new line (except for cases when a function is defined in a class header and has at most one statement. then 
                                                   it is permitted to write the whole function in just one line).
 * class member variables are to be prefixed with m, except for those publicly visible.
 * class members occur in the following order: public, protected, private
 * do not write more than one statement into one source line.
 * for big classes, it might be a good idea to group member functions into different categories.
