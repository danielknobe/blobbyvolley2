This document tries to design a new API for the Lua scripting interface
for bots. This API is based on the old API, but replaces ugly functions
and provides a more sophisticated way to implement serving behaviour.

The main difference of the new API is, that the bot is always programmed
for the left side. If the controlled blob is actually on the other side,
the API converts all values automatically.

These are the proposed function:

touches() : Number of own ball touches since last ball exchange.

launched() : Tells whether the player is jumping at the moment.

balldown(): Tells whether the ball is valid at the moment

estimate(): Estimated impact point of the ball, without collision

estimx(number) : Estimates ball x component for n timesteps
estimy(number) : Estimates ball y component for n timesteps

ballx() : x component of the ball position

bally() : y component of the ball position

bspeedx() : x component of the ball velocity

bspeedy() : y component of the ball velocity

posx() : x component of own position

posy() : y component of own position

oppx() : x component of opponent position

oppy() : y component of opponent position

debug(number) : Prints a number to stderr for debugging purposes


Scripts MUST provide these entry point:

function OnServe(ballready) : Called when the ball went down and the controlled
	blob has to serve it next. The boolean parameter is true when the ball
	is already placed.
function OnOpponentServe() : Called after balldown when the opponent has to
				serve the next ball
function OnGame() : Called during the normal game


What is missing:

- Functions to query score (for dynamic strength bots)

- Controlling Functions:
	The controls should now be accessed through the globals
	blobby_moveleft, blobby_moveright, blobby_moveup.
	But a moveto()-like function could be handy.

- Mathematical Functions:
	These should be provided by the standard Lua mathematical library
	of lualib
