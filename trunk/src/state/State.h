/*! \class State
	\brief Base class for all programme states.
	\details A programm state describes which state a programme is in
			( e.g. MainMenu, OptionsMenu, SingleplayerGame etc. ). It defines
			an abstract step function which is called each frame for the
			currently active state.
			Switching to a new state is a little cumbersome right now, as
			it requires deleting the current State (deleteCurrentState())
			and setting the new state afterwards. This approach is
			very error prone and generally not nice, so I hope we can
			replace it someday with something better ;)
