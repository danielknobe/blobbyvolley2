/**
 * @defgroup RAKNET_MESSAGE_ID Message Identifier 
 * 
 * You should not edit the file PacketEnumerations.h as it is a part of RakNet static library
 * To define your own message id, define an enum following the code example that follows. 
 *
 * @code
 * enum {
 *   ID_MYPROJECT_MSG_1 = ID_RESERVED_9 + 1, 
 *   ID_MYPROJECT_MSG_2, 
 *    ... 
 * };
 * @endcode 
 *
 * @note RakNet define message ID as a 1 byte information. If you
 * require more than 256 message IDs do not reuse the function
 * Multiplayer::GetPacketIdentifier and replace the existing one by a
 * correct version of this function the version. In this case you can
 * integrate in the code of your project the file Multiplayer.h and
 * edit this file to fits your needs.

	//
	// Ignore these:
	ID_CONNECTED_PING,   //!< 0: Ping from a connected system.  Update timestamps (internal use only)
	ID_UNCONNECTED_PING, //!< 1: Ping from an unconnected system.  Reply but do not update timestamps. (internal use only)
	ID_UNCONNECTED_PING_OPEN_CONNECTIONS,   //!< 2: Ping from an unconnected system.  Only reply if we have open connections. Do not update timestamps. (internal use only)
	ID_CONNECTED_PONG,   //!< 3: Pong from a connected system.  Update timestamps (internal use only)
	ID_REQUEST_STATIC_DATA,   //!< 4: Someone asked for our static data (internal use only)
	ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST,   //!< 5: Asking for a new connection (internal use only)
	ID_SECURED_CONNECTION_RESPONSE,   //!< 6: Connecting to a secured server/peer
	ID_SECURED_CONNECTION_CONFIRMATION,   //!< 7: Connecting to a secured server/peer
	ID_RPC,   //!< 8: Remote procedure call (internal use only)
	ID_BROADCAST_PINGS,   //!< 9: Server / Client only - The server is broadcasting the pings of all players in the game (internal use only)
	ID_SET_RANDOM_NUMBER_SEED,   //!< 10: Server / Client only - The server is broadcasting a random number seed (internal use only)
	ID_RPC_MAPPING,   //!< 11: Packet that tells us the packet contains an integer ID to name mapping for the remote system
	ID_KEEPALIVE, //!< 12: Just a reliable keepalive
	ID_OPEN_CONNECTION_REQUEST, //!< 13: Guaranteed offline message so we know when to reset and start a new connection
	ID_OPEN_CONNECTION_REPLY, ///!< 14: Guaranteed offline message response so we know when to reset and start a new connection
	//Handle these below.  Possible recipients in [...]
	ID_PONG,   //!< [CLIENT|PEER] 15: Pong from an unconnected system.  First byte is ID_PONG, second 4 bytes is the ping, following bytes is system specific enumeration data.
	ID_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_MISMATCH,   //!< [CLIENT|PEER] 16: We preset an RSA public key which does not match what the system we connected to is using.
	ID_REMOTE_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION,   //!< [CLIENT] 17: In a client/server environment, a client other than ourselves has disconnected gracefully.  Packet::playerID is modified to reflect the playerID of this client.
	ID_REMOTE_CONNECTION_LOST,   //!< [CLIENT] 18: In a client/server environment, a client other than ourselves has been forcefully dropped. Packet::playerID is modified to reflect the playerID of this client.
	ID_REMOTE_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION,   //!< [CLIENT] 19: In a client/server environment, a client other than ourselves has connected.  Packet::playerID is modified to reflect the playerID of this client.
	ID_REMOTE_EXISTING_CONNECTION,   //!< [CLIENT] 20: On our initial connection to the server, we are told of every other client in the game.  Packet::playerID is modified to reflect the playerID of this client.
	ID_REMOTE_STATIC_DATA,   //!< [CLIENT] - 21: Got the data for another client
	ID_CONNECTION_BANNED,   //!< [PEER|CLIENT] 22: We are banned from the system we attempted to connect to.
	ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED,   //!< [PEER|CLIENT] 23: In a client/server environment, our connection request to the server has been accepted.
	ID_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION,   //!< [PEER|SERVER] 24: A remote system has successfully connected.
	ID_NO_FREE_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS,   //!< [PEER|CLIENT] 25: The system we attempted to connect to is not accepting new connections.
	ID_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION,   //!< [PEER|SERVER|CLIENT] 26: The system specified in Packet::playerID has disconnected from us.  For the client, this would mean the server has shutdown.
	ID_CONNECTION_LOST,   //!< [PEER|SERVER|CLIENT] 27: Reliable packets cannot be delivered to the system specifed in Packet::playerID.  The connection to that system has been closed.
	ID_TIMESTAMP,   //!< [PEER|SERVER|CLIENT] 28: The four bytes following this byte represent an unsigned int which is automatically modified by the difference in system times between the sender and the recipient. Requires that you call StartOccasionalPing.
	ID_RECEIVED_STATIC_DATA,   //!< [PEER|SERVER|CLIENT] 29: We got a bitstream containing static data.  You can now read this data. This packet is transmitted automatically on connections, and can also be manually sent.
	ID_INVALID_PASSWORD,   //!< [PEER|CLIENT] 30: The remote system is using a password and has refused our connection because we did not set the correct password.
	ID_MODIFIED_PACKET,   //!< [PEER|SERVER|CLIENT] 31: A packet has been tampered with in transit.  The sender is contained in Packet::playerID.
	ID_REMOTE_PORT_REFUSED,   //!< [PEER|SERVER|CLIENT] 32: [11/14/05 - DEPRECIATED: No longer returned] The remote host is not accepting data on this port.  This only comes up when connecting to yourself on the same computer and there is no bound socket on that port.
	ID_VOICE_PACKET,   //!< [PEER] 33: This packet contains voice data.  You should pass it to the RakVoice system.
	ID_UPDATE_DISTRIBUTED_NETWORK_OBJECT,   //!< [CLIENT|SERVER] 34: Indicates creation or update of a distributed network object.  Pass to DistributedNetworkObjectManager::Instance()->HandleDistributedNetworkObjectPacket
	ID_DISTRIBUTED_NETWORK_OBJECT_CREATION_ACCEPTED,   //!< [CLIENT] 35: Client creation of a distributed network object was accepted.  Pass to DistributedNetworkObjectManager::Instance()->HandleDistributedNetworkObjectPacketCreationAccepted
	ID_DISTRIBUTED_NETWORK_OBJECT_CREATION_REJECTED,   //!< [CLIENT] 36: Client creation of a distributed network object was rejected.  Pass to DistributedNetworkObjectManager::Instance()->HandleDistributedNetworkObjectPacketCreationRejected
