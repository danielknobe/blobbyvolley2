	\brief class representing a blobby game.
	\details
	This class represents a single game between two players
	It applys the rules itself and provides an interface for querying
	different parameters. For this purpose it is designed as something
	similar to a singleton, but it can be instantiated
	multiple times on a server or be completely unavailable
