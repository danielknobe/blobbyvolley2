// This rendering class reduces all drawing stuff to a few calls
// to refresh the objects states. It also abstracts from specific
// graphics APIs.
// The following implementations are planned (ordered by importance)
//
// RenderManagerSDL:
// 	Uses standard SDL blits for drawing. It depends on precomputed
// 	rotated sprites and colors the blobs manually.
// 	Its fixed to the traditional resolution 800x600.
// RenderManagerGL2D:
// 	This manager relies on OpenGL to accelerate 2D drawing on systems
// 	like Linux/X11 where SDL acceleration is difficult. It rotates and
// 	colors its sprites in realtime, but still uses 2D graphics.
// RenderManagerGL3D:
// 	The GL3D is the top-end RenderManager. It uses newly created meshes
// 	and therefore supports vertex morphing for the blobs. It makes use 
// 	of OpenGL to present special effects like per-pixel-lighting, 
// 	stencil shadows, motion blur, and much more. It will requiere
// 	OpenGL 2.0 compliant graphics hardware.
// RenderManagerGP2X:
// 	This manager is used to port Blobby Volley to the GP2X handheld.
// 	It makes use of a fixed resolution at 320x240 and others for TV-Out.
// 	It also uses highly optimised loading routines with raw image data.
// 	In all other terms its similar to the RenderManagerSDL
