=======
Primary:
Important:
- Ballshadowfix for SDL/OpenGL Renderer (may be for the Handheldversion too)

Near aims:
- Implementation of LUA-Script for external KI
- Gamepadsupport
- Make rendering frame independent, so the same gameplay can be provided on older machindes with a lower rendering framerate

Secondary:
- Add animated background (prerendered Animations, at least for SDL and GL2D)
- Add option for old and new volleyball ruleset
- Add time-capped game option
- Add speed option

Possible Changes at Physics (may be exported as configurable parameters if 
	disagreements do occur):
- Upper net collision damping
- Jump acceleration
- Blobby gravitation (the jump damping is fixed, it's just the double of the gravitation)
- Ball graviation
- Protection of downward reflections
- New Reflection models for net sphere 
	(for example: planar, sphere with bigger radius)

- Make Code compatible with gcc -Wall
