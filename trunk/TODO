======= TODO
Primary:
Important:
- Implement a global text manager which can do translation and handle utf8 strings (for example tell the real length of a string)

Near aims:
- Gamepadsupport
- Make rendering frame independent, so the same gameplay can be provided on older machindes with a lower rendering framerate
- Polish Linux integration and release installable source tarballs and eventually debs

Secondary:
- Make Physfs actions more transparent, for example show added search paths
- Seperate left/right blobby graphics for skin-creation
- Add animated background (prerendered Animations, at least for SDL and GL2D)
- Add option for old and new volleyball ruleset
- Add time-capped game option
