- Add animated background (prerendered Animations, at least for SDL and GL2D)

- Make rendering frame independent, so the same gameplay can be provided on
	older machindes with a lower rendering framerate


- Configurable Physic

Possible options:
	Reflection Protection (Ball is never reflected downwards)
	Kind of collision handling (spherical or plane)
	Inclusion of the net sphere radius for net border collision 
	Net overlapping fix (I don't know exactly what this fix does)
	
Possible parameters:
	Upper net collision damping	
	Jump acceleration
	Blobby gravitation (the jump damping is fixed, it's just the double of
		the gravitation)
	Ball graviation
